# build-eslint-plugin
Trying to learn how to build an ESLint plugin.

I saw a presentation at the 2016 KCDC (Kansas City Developer's Conference) about the Abstract Syntax Tree, and how tools like babel and eslint use it.  In an effort to learn this stuff, I am going to try and build a plugin of my own.
